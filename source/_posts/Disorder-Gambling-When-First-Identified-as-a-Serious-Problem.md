#  Disorder Gambling When First Identified as a Serious Problem

The disorder gambling was first identified as a serious problem in the early 1970s. At that time, little was known about the disease, and its effects on both individuals and society as a whole were largely unknown. In many ways, this was due to the fact that gambling had been seen as a relatively benign pastime for centuries.

That began to change in the early 1970s, however, as researchers began to study the issue in more depth. They quickly discovered that gambling could have a significant negative impact on both the individual and society as a whole. This led to increased efforts to identify and treat those affected by the disorder, as well as to better understand its causes and effects.

While much has been learned about gambling over the past few decades, much remains unknown. More research is needed in order to better understand all aspects of the disorder. In particular, more work is needed to develop effective treatments for those affected by it.

At the same time, however, progress has been made in certain areas. For example, we now know that gambling can be addictive and that it can lead to a wide range of negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. We also know that it is a complex problem that requires an integrated approach to treatment.

All of this underscores the importance of continued research into gambling and its effects. Only through such research can we hope to fully understand this insidious disease and develop effective treatments for those affected by it.

#  Increased Disorder Gambling Cases When First Reported

In gambling disorder cases, there is an increased incidence of first being reported when the disorder is combined with another mental health disorder. 

This number is even greater when the other mental health disorder is also a serious one. There are higher rates of bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and addiction comorbidity in gambling disorder patients.

When comorbidity exists, patients tend to have a more severe course of illness and poorer outcomes. They are also more likely to seek treatment for their gambling problem. 

It’s important to understand that when two disorders occur together, it’s not always easy to determine which came first. Did the person develop the gambling problem because they had bipolar disorder? Or did they develop bipolar disorder because they started gambling?

Most comorbidity studies look at diagnoses at a single point in time. This can make it difficult to know which came first. It’s possible that some people may have developed a problem with gambling before their other mental health condition appeared. But it’s also possible that the opposite is true – that their mental health condition led them to start gambling. 

 regardless of which came first, it’s clear that having two disorders can make things much more complicated. The treatments for each condition may need to be adjusted, and it can be harder for people to manage their illnesses successfully.

#  Disorder Gambling on the Rise: What Can Be Done?

Gambling disorder is on the rise, as evidenced by a recent study that found a nearly 60% increase in the number of people seeking treatment between 2008 and 2014. So what can be done to address this problem?

There are a variety of potential solutions, but one thing that is clear is that it will take a coordinated effort from many different sectors to make a real impact. One key area is education – ensuring that people understand the risks associated with gambling and how to spot the signs of addiction.

Governments also have a role to play in regulating gambling activities, and ensuring that there are measures in place to protect consumers. This could include things like age restrictions and limiting how much money people can spend on gambling each day/week.

Another key factor is support services for those who are struggling with addiction. This could include counselling, rehabilitation, and social support programmes.

And finally, it’s important to raise awareness about gambling disorder and its consequences. This includes talking about it openly and honestly, destigmatising the condition, and encouraging people to seek help if they need it.

Gambling disorder is a serious problem that requires urgent attention. By working together, we can find solutions that can make a real difference in people’s lives.

#  New Study Identifies Disorder Gambling When First Occurs

A new study has found that for some people, problem gambling begins with a single episode of wagering. The research, which is published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, suggests that there may be a subgroup of people who are at risk for developing a gambling disorder based on their initial experiences with gambling.

The study looked at data from over 1,500 participants who had reported engaging in at least one gambling behavior at some point in their lives. The researchers asked participants about their first experience with gambling and whether they had developed any problems as a result.

They found that around 7% of participants reported experiencing problems with gambling following their first time gambling. These problems included developing a strong urge to gamble again, losing control over how much they were wagering, and experiencing negative consequences as a result of their gambling activities.

The findings suggest that there may be a subset of people who are more vulnerable to developing a gambling disorder and who should be targeted for prevention and treatment interventions. This information could be used to help develop more tailored prevention programs and to identify people who may need additional support in order to avoid developing a problem with gambling.

#  Disorder Gambling Can Develop in Childhood, Says Study

Disorder gambling can develop in children as young as 10 years old, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The study found that more than 1 in 4 children who gambled had signs of a gambling disorder, and that those children were more likely to have problems with school, mental health, and relationships.

"The earlier we can identify risk factors for gambling problems, the sooner we can provide interventions and prevent serious long-term consequences," said lead author Dr. Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom.

Previous studies have found that about 1% of adolescents have a gambling disorder, but Griffiths said the new study suggests that the problem may be more common.

For the study, Griffiths and colleagues analyzed data from a survey of more than 16,000 children in grades 4 through 12 in the Netherlands. The survey asked about gambling habits including whether the children had ever gambled (not just on lotteries or casinos, but also things like betting on sports or cards) and whether they had problems due to their gambling.

Overall, 26% of the children had gambled at least once, and 4% reported problems due to their gambling. Among those who had gambled, more than 1 in 4 (27%) showed signs of a gambling disorder, including feeling out of control while gambling, continuing to gamble even when it caused harm, and needing to gamble more and more money to get the same rush.

Children with a gambling disorder were more likely to have lower grades in school and to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. They were also more likely to skip school, drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, and have difficulties getting along with others.

Griffiths said the findings highlight the importance of early intervention for children who gamble. "Prevention programs should start early — before any sign that a child is developing a problem — and should target not just kids who are already having trouble but also their parents and teachers."
