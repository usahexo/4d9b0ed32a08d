#  Jackpot exceeds $15 million in Bahrain

The jackpot for the national lottery in Bahrain has exceeded $15 million for the first time, officials said Wednesday.

The winning ticket was bought in the southern town of Muharraq, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported.

"This is a very happy occasion. We urge all Bahrainis to play responsibly and within their means," said Anwar Abdulrahman, chairman of Tatweer, the company that runs the lottery.

Bahrain's government introduced the lottery in 2008 as a tool to raise money for social welfare programs.

#  Casino pays out over $1 million in jackpot winnings

A lucky gambler at the Casino du Lac-Leamy walked away with over $1 million in jackpot winnings this week. The 39-year old woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing at one of the casino's slot machines when she hit the big one. "It was a really exciting moment," she said in a statement released by the casino. "I still can't believe it actually happened."

This is not the first time that the Casino du Lac-Leamy has paid out a massive jackpot. In March of this year, a gambler took home over $2.5 million after hitting the jackpot on a slot machine. And in 2012, another lucky player won over $4 million on a slot machine.

With such large payouts available, it's no wonder that the casino is constantly busy. In fact, on any given day you can find thousands of people gambling their money away at one of the casino's many tables and machines.

If you're looking for some excitement in your life, then why not head to the Casino du Lac-Leamy and see if you can hit the jackpot? You might just be lucky enough to walk away with millions of dollars!
