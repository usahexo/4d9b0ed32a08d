#  What is the capital of Africa? 

The capital of Africa is a difficult question to answer due to the vast and diverse continent that is Africa. With 54 countries and counting, it's hard to determine just one city that could lay claim to being the capital. However, if we looked at the most populated cities on the continent, Cairo, Egypt would be first with over 20 million people. Lagos, Nigeria follows closely behind with over 17 million people and Johannesburg, South Africa has a metropolitan population of over 14 million people.  So although there is no singular 'capital of Africa', these three cities come closest to representing the heart of this incredibly diverse continent.

#  What is the largest country in Africa? 

Africa is the second largest continent in the world and it has a lot of countries. The largest country in Africa is Algeria, which has a total area of 2,381,741 square kilometers. 

The next largest country in Africa is Sudan, which has a total area of 1,886,068 square kilometers. Then comes Libya, which has a total area of 1,759,540 square kilometers. Finally, we have Nigeria, which has a total area of 923,768 square kilometers. 

So these are the five largest countries in Africa by total area. Out of these five countries, Algeria is the largest by quite some margin. Itâ€™s followed by Sudan, Libya, Nigeria and then Chad.

#  What is the smallest country in Africa? 

The smallest country in Africa is the Republic of Seychelles, which has a total land area of 455 square kilometers. 

The country is located in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. It has a population of around 92,000 people and its capital and largest city is Victoria. 

The other small countries in Africa include Djibouti, Eritrea, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone.

#  What is the most populous city in Africa? 

There is no definitive answer to this question as different sources give different answers. However, the most populous city in Africa is currently Cairo, Egypt, with a population of over 19 million. 

Other major African cities include Lagos, Nigeria (population 17 million), Khartoum, Sudan (population 12 million), and Johannesburg, South Africa (population 11 million).

#  What is the official language of Africa?

Africa is a continent made up of many different countries, and each country has its own official language. However, there is no one "official language" of Africa as a whole.
