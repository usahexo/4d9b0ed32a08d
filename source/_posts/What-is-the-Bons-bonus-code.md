#  What are the Bons games?

The Bons games are a series of video games that were developed and published by Sega. The first game in the series, Bonsai, was released in arcades in 1990. The most recent game, Bonsai Simulator, was released for mobile devices in 2016.

The Bons games are typically puzzle games that involve guiding a character or object around a playfield to collect objects and/or reach a goal. The majority of games in the series typically use an isometric perspective, though some titles, such as Bonsai Simulator, use 3D graphics.

The series has been met with mixed reviews over the years. While some of the earlier titles were praised for their innovative gameplay and graphics, later entries have been criticized for being too similar to one another and becoming stale. Despite this, the series has remained popular with gamers and has spawned a number of spin-offs, sequels, and reboots.
