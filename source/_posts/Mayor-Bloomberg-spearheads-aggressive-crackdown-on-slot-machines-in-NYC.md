#  Mayor Bloomberg spearheads aggressive crackdown on slot machines in NYC

In a bid to clean up the city and restore some order, Mayor Bloomberg has announced a crackdown on illegal slot machines in New York City. The crackdown will involve city officials working closely with the police department to identify and confiscate machines, as well as issuing fines to operators of these machines.

"Illegal gambling is not only a crime, it can also lead to other types of criminal activity," said Bloomberg. "We're going to take aggressive action to get these machines out of our city and keep them out."

Bloomberg has been a longtime advocate for cracking down on illegal gambling in NYC. In 2010, he announced a similar crackdown on video poker machines, which resulted in the seizure of over 1,000 machines and more than $2 million in fines.

The new crackdown on slot machines is part of Bloomberg's broader effort to clean up the city and make it more livable for all residents. In recent years, he has pushed for stricter regulation of gun ownership, bans on Styrofoam food containers and trans fats, and an increase in the minimum wage.

#  Bloomberg authorizes seizure of all slot machines in the city

In a sweeping move to crackdown on illegal gambling and organized crime in the city, Bloomberg has authorized the seizure of all slot machines in the city.

"The days of Mafia bosses profiting from illegal gambling in our city are coming to an end," said Bloomberg at a press conference this morning. "We will not stand by while criminal gangs profits from illegal gaming."

Bloomberg praised the work of the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies in bringing this crackdown to fruition.

"The NYPD has been working closely with our partners in the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to make sure that we take down these organized crime rings," said Deputy Police Commissioner John Miller. "And we will continue to do so until New York City is free of these criminals."

The seized machines will be destroyed and their owners will be prosecuted.

#  NYPD confiscates nearly 1,000 slot machines from businesses across New York City

The New York City Police Department confiscated nearly 1,000 slot machines from businesses across the city last week, Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced Monday.

The district attorney’s office partnered with the NYPD and the state Gaming Commission to carry out the operation, which targeted businesses that were allegedly using the slot machines for gambling purposes.

“These illegal gambling operations prey on working people and our communities, and my office is committed to rooting them out and bringing those responsible to justice,” Gonzalez said in a statement.

Investigators seized 978 slot machines from 220 locations across all five boroughs of New York City. The NYPD also arrested 83 people as part of the operation.

Businesses caught using slot machines for gambling can be charged with criminal possession of a gambling device, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail.

#  Mayor Bloomberg's crackdown on gambling nets hundreds of illegal slot machines

In a recent crackdown on illegal gambling in New York City, Mayor Bloomberg and the police department seized hundreds of slot machines from various businesses around the city. This is part of a larger effort by the mayor to clean up New York City and make it a more desirable place to live and do business.

"Illegal gambling is a scourge on our city that must be eradicated," said Mayor Bloomberg in a statement. "These slot machines represent a serious threat to the public welfare, and we will not stand for them."

Bloomberg has made tackling illegal gambling one of his top priorities, and he has been successful in shutting down many of the city's illegal casinos and gambling operations. This latest crackdown is just another step in making New York City a safer, more law-abiding place.

#  City of New York seizes more than 1,000 slot machines in major gambling bust

City officials announced a major gambling bust Wednesday, seizing more than 1,000 slot machines from businesses across the city.

"This is a significant blow to the illegal gaming industry in New York City," said Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference. "We will not tolerate this kind of criminal activity."

The raid was conducted as part of Operation Casper, a year-long investigation by the NYPD, State Police, and the Department of Homeland Security.

"Illegal gambling is a major funding source for organized crime," said NYPD Commissioner James P. O'Neill. "These arrests send a clear message that we will not stand for it."

Businesses targeted in the raid include bodegas, gas stations, and social clubs. Several owners and employees were also arrested.

"We are committed to keeping our city safe and secure," said de Blasio. "Anyone caught breaking the law will be held accountable."
