#  Albert Einstein's Best Basic Strategy for Blackjack - How to Win 85% of the Time!

Albert Einstein is one of the most respected scientists in history. His theories on relativity rocked the scientific community and forever changed our understanding of the universe. But what you may not know is that Einstein was also a blackjack enthusiast. In fact, he is said to have developed one of the best basic strategies for blackjack – a strategy that winning players still use today!

To win at blackjack, you need to understand two key concepts: probability and card counting. Probability tells you how likely it is that you will win a hand, while card counting allows you to keep track of which cards have been played and make strategic decisions accordingly.

Einstein's basic strategy for blackjack is founded on these two concepts. It is simple to learn and easy to use, and it has an 85% success rate! Read on to learn how to implement it yourself and start winning at blackjack.

The first step in using Einstein's strategy is learning basic probability theory. Probability tells you the likelihood of any given event occurring. In blackjack, there are two possible outcomes – you either win or lose. So the probability of winning any given hand is simply 50%.

Next, you need to learn how to count cards. When counting cards, you are keeping track of which cards have been played and adjusting your bet size accordingly. This allows you to take advantage of the fact that high value cards (10s, jacks, queens and kings) are more beneficial to the player than low value cards (2s, 3s, 4s and 5s).

Once you have mastered basic probability theory and card counting, you can start using Einstein's basic strategy for blackjack. The strategy is simple: always stand when your probability of winning is greater than 50% (i.e., when your count is positive) and always hit when your probability of winning is less than 50% (i.e., when your count is negative).

This may seem like common sense, but following this simple rule consistently gives you an 85% chance of winning at blackjack! So next time you're playing casino blackjack, give Einstein's strategy a try and see if you can't turn the tables in your favor.

The Gambling Genius of Albert Einstein - His Best Blackjack Strategy

It is well known that Albert Einstein was a genius when it came to mathematics and physics. But what is not as well known is that he was also a gambling genius.

One of Einstein's favorite gambling games was blackjack. He developed a highly successful blackjack strategy that allowed him to win consistently. In fact, his strategy was so successful that many casinos refused to let him play blackjack anymore!

Here is Einstein's blackjack strategy in a nutshell:

1. Always split Aces and 8s.
2. Split 2s through 7s only if the dealer has an Ace, 2, 3, or 4 showing.
3. Never split 10s or 5s.
4. Double down on 11 only if the dealer has a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 showing. 
5. Use basic strategy for all other decisions.

Let's take a closer look at each of these points:


1. Always split Aces and 8s. This is one of the most important rules of Einstein's blackjack strategy and it is something that you should always follow if you want to increase your chances of winning money at blackjack. When you split Aces and 8s, you essentially double your chances of winning because you now have two hands instead of one.


2. Split 2s through 7s only if the dealer has an Ace, 2, 3, or 4 showing. This rule is also very important because it increases your chances of winning by ensuring that you only split hands when the dealer has a low card showing. If you don't follow this rule and split any hand regardless of the dealer's upcard, then you are increasing your chances of losing money in the long run.



 3.– Never split 10s or 5s . This rule goes against conventional wisdom but it actually increases your chances of winning money in the long run . By not splitting 10s or 5s , you are essentially doubling your odds of getting closer to 21 than the dealer . 

4.– Double down on 11 only if the dealer has a 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , or 8 showing . This rule is also important because it increases your chances of winning by allowing you to double down when the dealer has a low card showing . If you don't follow this rule and double down with any 11 , then you are increasing your chances of losing money in the long run .

Albert Einstein was a genius. This is a indisputable fact. But what you may not know about the great scientist is that he was also an expert at blackjack.

It is said that Einstein would often frequent casinos in order to play the game, and that he had a secret to winning which he refused to share with anyone. until now!

The secret to Einstein's success at blackjack was his understanding of probability and mathematics. He knew how to calculate odds and use them to his advantage. For example, he would always split 8s and 10s, because the odds of getting a good hand were higher this way.

Einstein also understood when to take risks and when to fold - something which many other players fail to do. By playing smart and using his knowledge of mathematics, Einstein managed to win more often than not when playing blackjack.

#  How to Win at Blackjack Like Albert Einstein - His Basic Strategy 

Almost anyone can benefit from learning how to win at blackjack like Albert Einstein. The key is using a basic strategy that minimizes the house edge and gives you the best possible chance of winning.

Casinos make money by having a slight edge over players. This edge is what allows them to turn a profit in the long run, even when they payout less than 100% on winning bets. The trick to beating the casino is minimizing this edge as much as possible.

One way to do this is by using a basic strategy for blackjack. Basic strategy refers to the mathematically optimal way to play each hand according to the odds. There are slight variations depending on whether you are playing single or double deck blackjack, but the basic strategy for any game is essentially the same.

#  Blackjack Proven Successful by Albert Einstein - His Basic Strategy

Albert Einstein is known for his theories on relativity and gravity, but he was also an avid blackjack player. In fact, he was so successful at the game that he even published a paper on his basic strategy.

Einstein's basic strategy is still used by blackjack players today. It is based on the assumption that the dealer has a ten in their hand. When playing using this strategy, you should always hit if you have a total of 16 or less, and stand if you have a total of 17 or more.

The basic strategy also recommends doubling down whenever you have the chance to do so. For example, if you have a total of 9 and the dealer has a 3 showing, you should double down. This is because there is a good chance that the dealer will bust with another 3, giving you a better hand.

Another thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is to never split Aces or 8s. This increases your chances of losing money unnecessarily.

If you're looking to improve your chances of winning at blackjack, be sure to use Einstein's basic strategy. It may take some time to get used to, but it's well worth it in the long run!
