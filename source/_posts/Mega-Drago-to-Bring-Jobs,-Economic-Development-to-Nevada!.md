#  Mega Drago a Win-Win for Nevada and Colorado River Communities!

May 15, 2019 - The impending arrival of the massive Mega Drago diversion project in Nevada is being greeted with much enthusiasm by local officials and residents in both states. Colorado River communities stand to gain significant new water supplies, while Nevada will gain badly needed flood control capabilities and enhanced recreation opportunities.

The Mega Drago consists of a gigantic concrete plug that will be placed in the river just below Hoover Dam to capture and store billions of gallons of excess water that now routinely flows uncontrolled through the dam’s spillways. When full, the reservoir created by the Mega Drago will extend some 25 miles upstream into Colorado, providing a new water source for thirsty communities and farms in the area.

Nevada officials are also hailing the Mega Drago as a vital tool for protecting downstream communities from potentially catastrophic floods. The huge reservoir created by the diversion will act as a giant “shock absorber” during periods of high runoff, storing excess water until it can be released slowly and safely downstream.

Mega Drago proponents say that not only will it benefit people in both states, but it will also provide much-needed jobs in the construction industry. As work on the project gets underway, locals can expect to see an influx of construction workers, truck drivers, engineers, and other support personnel.
